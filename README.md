Project objective: To build an online banking application.
Background of the problem statement:
An online banking platform where users can transfer money, check account balances, and do other banking operations.
The tasks that need to be performed are as follows:
•
Create a specification document detailing the product’s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions
o
Document the application flow
•
Specify the number and duration of sprints required
o
Plan more than two sprints to complete the application
•
Implement Java concepts to create this application, including data structures for sorting and searching
The flow and features of the application are:

Users can log in to the application
•
Manages bank account operations, retrieves balance, and provides access to transaction history.
•
Displays the current balance.
•
Allows the user to transfer money from the account, with error handling for insufficient balance.
•
Displays the last five transactions.

o
Exception Handling
o
Collections
Business logic/exceptional scenarios:
o
Checks if the deposit amount is positive before updating the account balance and recording the transaction.
o
Checks if the transfer amount is positive and if there are sufficient funds (balance). If not, it throws exceptions.
